As IBus Cangjie is a Cangjians project, it is subject to our
[general guidelines for contribution](/contribute.html), so be sure to read
them first.

That being said, there are a couple of things which are specific to
IBus Cangjie.

First of all, it is written in Python 3, so if you want to contribute to the
code, you'll need to know a bit about that.

If you find a bug, please make sure it is not
[already known](https://github.com/Cangjians/ibus-cangjie/issues), and if not
please [report it](https://github.com/Cangjians/ibus-cangjie/issues/new).

Of course, when looking at the list of open bugs, if you find one you would
like to fix, just go ahead and send us a pull request.

We love pull requests fixing bugs or implementing new features, especially
when they come along with new unit tests!

Finally, because IBus Cangjie is user-visible software, it needs to be
translated. We use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) for that, so if you
want to translate IBus Cangjie in your language,
[head over there](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/ibus-cangjie/) and
submit your translations.
